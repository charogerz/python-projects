I chose to use this final assignment to explore more data visualization, especially in libraries that we did not get to fully explore in class. As discussed, I used my Amazon data and explored my order history over multiple years to see if I could take a large dataset and plot it various ways and with various customizations added. I used matplotlib, plotly, and bokeh for this final assignment.
